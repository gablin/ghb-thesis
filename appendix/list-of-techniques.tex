\chapter{List of Techniques}
\labelAppendix{list-of-techniques}

The list starts on the next page, and its legend appears at the end of the list.
The techniques are ordered chronologically.

Note that the capabilities of all techniques have been set to reflect those
exhibited by current implementation prototypes and known applications, not the
capabilities that could potentially be achieved through extensions of the
technique.
